# Image_Processing_Algorithms

## Description
Image_Processing_Algorithms is a desktop application built with PyQt that implements various image processing algorithms from scratch. It allows users to apply operations like contrast stretching, smoothing, edge detection (Canny, Sobel), sharpening, and more.

## Features
- **Segmentation**: Manual and automatic options
- **Contrast Stretching**: Histogram equalization
- **Smoothing**: Linear (Box/Mean Filter) and Non-linear (Min Filter)
- **Edge Detection**: Canny and Sobel filters
- **Sharpening**: Laplacian and enhancement techniques
- **Time Transmission**: Image size, baud rate, grayscale channel calculations
- **Histogram Analysis**: Displays original and output histograms
